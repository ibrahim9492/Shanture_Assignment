## ▶️ Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Ensure your **backend server is running** and accessible to provide data.

## 🎨 Styling & Theming

The application is styled using **Material-UI (MUI)**. The dark theme is implemented via a **React Context** to allow for easy toggling across the entire application.

### Theme Implementation Details:

  - A **`ThemeContext`** manages the theme state (`light` or `dark`).
  - The **`ThemeProvider`** from MUI wraps the entire application, making the theme accessible to all components.
  - **`useTheme()`** and **`useContext()`** hooks are used to retrieve the current theme and the theme toggle function.

## 📊 Perfecting the Charts

The application uses `echarts-for-react` to render charts. To ensure the charts look perfect in both themes:

  - The chart's `backgroundColor` is set to **`transparent`**.
  - **MUI's theme palette** is directly used to style the chart elements (e.g., axis labels, lines, and data series colors). This creates a seamless and integrated look that automatically adapts to the selected theme.
